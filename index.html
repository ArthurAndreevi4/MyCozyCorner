        <h1>Welcome to My First Website</h1>
        <p>I welcome you, my dear, mysterious visitor to my page. Here you will find information about who I am and what I do in life, and here you can listen to music & chat in the appropriate section. And if you still have questions, you can ask them to me in the contacts section.</p>
        <h2>The purpose of creation:</h2>
        <p>Everything is quite simple. Taking into account the trends of updates of everything that is possible, I don't like the innovations that are being introduced to websites and applications (but not all, there are also good ones), and I decided to just create a spare airfield with music and chat. And all this in a minimalist style and simple design. As far as it turned out, think for yourself.</p>
        <h2>P.S.</h2>
        <p>Yes, I could create it in html5. And even started to do it, but the cosiness of the old and good internet was lost, I didn't like how it looks and works and had to take a step back in order to do it the way I wanted.</p>

<h1>Metro 2035 - Dmitry Glukhovsky</h1>
<p>Post-apocalyptic science fiction novel. Glukhovsky's third book in the core Metro series, it serves as a sequel to Metro 2033 and Metro 2034. Like previous novels in the series, Metro 2035 is primarily set in the Moscow Metro and the ruins of Moscow itself in the aftermath of a nuclear apocalypse. 2035 follows Artyom, the protagonist of Metro 2033, as he attempts to make contact with other survivors in the world. Metro 2035 is partially inspired by the video game Metro: Last Light. In turn, Metro Exodus is a game loosely based on Metro 2035.</p>

<h1>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep - Philip K. Dick</h1>
<p>Dystopian science fiction novel, first published in 1968. The novel is set in a post-apocalyptic San Francisco, where Earth's life has been greatly damaged by a nuclear global war, leaving most animal species endangered or extinct. The main plot follows Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter who is tasked with "retiring" six escaped Nexus-6 model androids, while a secondary plot follows John Isidore, a man of sub-par IQ who aids the fugitive androids. The book served as the primary basis for the 1982 film Blade Runner, even though some aspects of the novel were changed, and many elements and themes from it were used in the film's 2017 sequel Blade Runner 2049.</p>

<h1>The Emperor's Soul - Brandon Sanderson</h1>
<p>Fantasy novella. Shai is a thief and practitioner of magical forgery who has been arrested and sentenced to death. The Emperor's corrupt advisors offer to free her if she agrees to forge a new soul for the Emperor, who has been left brain dead by an assassination attempt. She agrees, but plans to escape. She is given 100 days to forge the soul, given only official histories, the Emperor's diary, and Gaotona, the only non-corrupt advisor, a task even she deems impossible. As the two research the Emperor's past together, Gaotona learns more about forgery, a generally detested practice, and the two develop a grudging respect for each other. During this task, Shai realizes the Emperor had once been idealistic, but a life of leisure resulted in his recent indulgence, and resolves to create and tweak the soul as her masterpiece, setting him on a better path. Though many opportunities present themselves, Shai puts off escaping until the work is done, whereupon Gaotona helps her win her freedom against his colleagues' treachery. The Emperor, with the forged soul, resumes his rule.</p>
